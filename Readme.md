# MochaOS

MochaOS aims to be a lightweight hackable operating system.

In the process of writing a kernel.

Might I add, it needs UEFI support to work anywhere but QEMU, or VirtualBox

## Features

- Custom Bootloader
- Own FS
- Something called kernel thats not a kernel

## Plans

see Misc/TODO.txt
